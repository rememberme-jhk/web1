    >a is a global social and solidarity economy (SSE) network that aims to
    serve as a hub for sharing visions and experiences through cross-border
    collaboration and cooperation based on multilateral
    (public-private-community) partnerships for an inclusive, equitable and
    human centered world for all of us. <br />The development of the GSEF began
    following the Seoul Declaration, which was adopted by eight local
    governments and nine social economy organizations during GSEF 2013, held in
    Seoul on November 5 - 7, 2013 on the theme 'New Discovery of Collaboration'
    (www.gsef2013.org).
